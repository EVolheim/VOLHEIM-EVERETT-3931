# Conclusion

  The Battles of Dunkirk, Stalingrad, and the Bulge each represent crucial strategic losses for Germany, displaying the German military’s progressive loss of momentum over the course of the war. In each of these battles, Germany failed to achieve strategically important objectives and lost significant amounts of morale and resources (both human and technological). Thus, these battles all contributed to an increasingly inevitable German loss. On paper, Germany suffered a similar number of casualties to the Allies in the battles of Dunkirk and the Bulge (and actually suffered far fewer casualties than the Soviets in Stalingrad), but looking at the raw numbers alone does not tell the full story. Each casualty or loss of equipment hurt Germany a lot more than an equivalent loss would hurt the Allies because the Axis had a much smaller population, GDP, and industrial capacity; thus, its ability to replenish its resources as the war went on paled in comparison to that of the Allies. The Allies were able to continue fighting despite these casualties and equipment losses because they had, yet similar numbers of German losses weakened the German military and diminished its ability to win future battles. By the end of the Battle of the Bulge, Nazi Germany would no longer launch offensives on the Western Front, instead focusing on retreating and preparing for the end. So, looking at these three battles in conjunction with each other highlights the deterioration of Germany’s military strength throughout the war as they were not able to deal with the burden of losing so many resources. Once an extremely aggressive military that invaded in order to advance its expansionist ideology, these three battles each dealt important blows to the German military until it no longer had the ability to do so. Germany was left much weaker and unable to keep up sustained warfare with the Allies, which ultimately set the stage for Germany’s surrender on May 7th, 1945.
