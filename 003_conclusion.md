# Conclusion

  The Battles of Dunkirk, Stalingrad, and the Bulge each represent “turning points” in different ways for Germany, displaying their progressive loss of momentum over the course of the war. In each of these battles, Germany failed to achieve strategically important objectives and lost significant amounts of morale and resources (both human and technological). Thus, these battles all contributed to an increasingly inevitable German loss. By the end of the Battle of the Bulge, Nazi Germany would no longer launch offensives on the Western Front, instead focusing on retreating and preparing for the end. Ultimately, looking at these three battles in conjunction with each other highlights the deterioration of Germany’s military strength throughout the war. Once an extremely aggressive military who invaded in order to advance its expansionist ideology, these turning points each dealt important blows to the German military until it became unfeasible for them to win the war.
