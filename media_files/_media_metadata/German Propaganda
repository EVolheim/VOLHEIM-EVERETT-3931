_title: German Propaganda Footage about the Battle of Dunkirk
description: This footage shows German fighter planes attacking Allied planes, ships, and troops at the Battle of Dunkirk, abandoned Allied equipment, and German soldiers capturing Allied POWs. Despite the Battle of Dunkirk being a victory for the Allies, Germany portrayed their side as valiantly and successfully attacking the Allies. They also spoke negatively of the Allies in the video; for instance, they accused France of ignoring its own peopleâ€™s interests to serve English Lords. The footage also omits the losses of German soldiers and equipment. These things were likely done to boost German morale by portraying themselves as a brave, capable military on the ideologically correct side of the war.
