# The Battle of Dunkirk (1940)

The Battle of Dunkirk occurred May 26th to June 4th, 1940, and was an important turning point in World War II for multiple reasons. While technically the battle was won by Germany, the specific conditions and events that occurred in this battle made it crucial for the Allied forces, and ultimately led to a power shift, with the Allied forces being on top. The Battle of Dunkirk is most famously known for the evacuation that occurred, but the battle itself highlights the strengths and weaknesses of Germany’s military, as well as how turning points in World War II were created from unexpected situations.
            The military tactics that were used in the Battle of Dunkirk were primarily the Luftwaffe. Germany used Blitzkrieg tactics, also known as lightning warfare, throughout France to quickly gain land and close in on England. [^1] The use of the Luftwaffe was crucial for Germany in this battle. Not only was it used to attack the Allies air forces, but also to bomb civilization and troops who were unreachable by German ground forces in Dunkirk. Prior to the start of the battle on May 26th, Dunkirk had been bombed by the Luftwaffe, and this continued throughout the evacuation and end of the battle. Although the Allied forces had a larger navy than Germany, “the shoals off the French and Belgian coasts precluded the possibility of the use of heavy ships…”. [^2] This blockage turned the battle into one primarily fought in the air. If this terrain had been less dangerous, it is likely Germany would have stopped the evacuation and caused hundreds of thousands more Allied deaths. 
On May 10, 1940, Germany used blitzkrieg tactics to trap the Allied forces in Dunkirk, leaving them stuck along the English Channel. Germany found that the terrain of Dunkirk was too dangerous to continue fighting the way they were. Hitler feared an Allied counterattack, as there was a failed attempt on May 21, and commanders believed it would be best to allow the ground troops to catch up, and as a response, Hitler issued a halt order on May 24, 1940. [^3] This stated that the ground forces would halt for three days, while the Luftwaffe continued bombings and attacking the Allied air forces. However, Hitler’s halt order allowed for 338,000 Allied forces to evacuate Dunkirk. On May 26th, the fighting continued. Ground soldiers continued to move forward, while the Luftwaffe bombed Dunkirk and the soldiers evacuating, as well as continuing the attacks on the Allied air forces. On June 4, 1940, it was declared that Germany had officially taken Dunkirk. [^4] Hitler’s interference in military operations may have been Germany’s downfall in the Battle of Dunkirk. Historians have debated whether or not Germany would have been able to continue their blitzkrieg tactics and defeat the Allied forces before an evacuation occurred if Hitler had not issued this order. The terrain was not as impossible to cross as Hitler believed, and the continuation of Germany’s whole army would have been much more successful than only the Luftwaffe. [^5] If this did occur, the famous Dunkirk Evacuation would have been impossible. 
            The Allied forces faced significant losses compared to Germany. Even though the evacuation was successful, 226 British ships and 168 Allied ships were sunk, along with 177 planes. The British Expeditionary Force lost 68,111 men by death or capture, and 40,000 French soldiers were captured as well. [^6] A German newspaper, titled Der Fürer, reported on June 3, 1940, that many English ships had been sunk and the port of Dunkirk had been destroyed by the bombings of the Luftwaffe. On June 4, 1940, Der Fürer reported having over 500 Allied planes shot down in attacks. The Allied forces also left behind many tanks and artillery machines, which the Germans were able to take and use for their benefit. [^7] For example, 2,472 guns, 63,879 vehicles, and 20,548 motorcycles were taken over by the Germans. [8] On the other hand, Germany did not experience much loss of supplies, likely due to the halt order issued by Hitler. This difference in losses contributed significantly to this military achievement by Germany. However, the unique situation of this battle, the evacuation, made this victory a major turning point that was not in Germany’s favor. While the opportunity for Germany to take over such a large amount of Allied weapons, machines, and vehicles would have likely played in their favor later on in the war, the morale boost the Allied forces experienced seemed to be much more significant.
            Based on the number of casualties and loss of supplies for the Allied forces, the Battle of Dunkirk would seem to be a complete disaster. However, that was not the case. The evacuation of troops was deemed a miracle, and Britain used this as propaganda and encouragement to fight Germany even harder than before. The term “Dunkirk Spirit” was created, and the morale of the Allied forces had significantly increased. [^9] The Allied forces also used this lost battle to their advantage in other ways: “Men and ships were lost, but over those days was set up the pattern for the Battle of Britain – that pattern of qualitative superiority that was to save Britain in the second great crisis of the war.” [^10] What makes this battle so unique is the power shift that occurred even when Germany won. The Allied forces were able to successfully carry out an evacuation that many deemed impossible, which was a much greater success than Germany’s win. This highlights the fact that turning points can occur at any point in wars and as a result of many different situations. While Germany did win the Battle of Dunkirk, their morale was not raised to the same degree. This significant morale increase by the Allied forces along with their calculated pattern led to a shift in power after this battle. While Dunkirk was only one battle, it set up a trajectory for the future, allowing the Allied forces to get ahead.

# The Battle of Stalingrad (1942-1943)

The European Front of the Second World War contained numerous turning points for the Allies but the final event that sealed the Ally victory was the Battle of the Bulge. Events such as Dunkirk and the Battle of Stalingrad may have been more significant for Germany’s defeat, but the Battle of the Bulge was the point horizon of the war after which there was statistically no way for the Axis powers to find victory in the war. In order to analyze the importance of this battle as a turning point, the following must be examined: the casualty count for the Axis, the broader context of what Axis defeat means, and an examination of the strategy guiding this battle. The context behind the assault is important to understand when evaluating the battle’s importance as a turning point. The war was going against the Germans in nearly every way and Hitler decided to pursue an all out final assault on the Ally forces. On December 16, 1944 the Germans invaded the thick Ardennes forest for the purpose of surprising and splitting the Ally army bearing down on the fatherland, focusing mainly on the cities of Bastogne-Brussels and Antwerp.1 The reason for this final effort is the German High Command believed surprise attacking the Allied forces could have split their army in half in order to delay their advance and weaken the attacking force in the hopes that the further war of attrition might go in favor of the Germans. As far as the scale of the conflict was concerned, the important statistics of this initial offensive was a massive German force of over 200,000 soldiers attacking a modest 83,000 Ally soldiers.2 The battle is considered to be the largest land battle in American history but beyond that it was one of the coldest battles ever experienced and this duality resulted in over 80,000 American casualties and about 81,000 German casualties, but the German forces suffered many more deaths than the Americans. The importance of this casualty count when evaluating the battle’s importance as a turning point, the current state of the war needs to be understood. Major losses have been piling for the Germans since Stalingrad and their supplies have been depleted, but their forces have started to be depleted from men. The war as itself was a massive battle of attrition meaning that each force was fighting until the last man and until they ran out of supplies. As the end of the war drew nearer, this battle of attrition was being lost by the germans, so enduring similar amounts of casualties to the allies in this battle was actually much more devastating for the German Army. Furthermore, The strategy of the German attack must be evaluated in order to determine the state of the war at the time and the battle’s importance as a turning point. In the early period of the war, Hitler and the German High Command were amongst the most competent military commanders in the World. Each German advance was planned in detail and executed through advanced military techniques such as Blitzkrieg and the rest of Europe had no answer to this military power. As time passed by in the war, the strategy of the High Command became more defensive than offensive, but also as Hitler grew more erratic the campaigns became not as well planned and in the case of the Battle of the Bulge showed desperation that led to German defeat. The assault was ill planned, but in order to be pulled off, there were objectives that needed to be met in a timely manner. The shock factor of the assault worked, but across the entire line of battle, Germans failed to achieve any of their objectives and missed all of their time restraints which led to a longer offensive that lasted through the winter. 4 The Germans outmanned their opponents over 2 to 1, but due to lack of supplies and well trained men could not perform a blitzkrieg operation like in the early years of the war. Overall, German strategy at the beginning of the war relied heavily upon the skill of their men and the ability to mobilize their forces in a quick manner. Towards the end of the war including the Battle of the Bulge, they no longer had the men, equipment, or strategic power to pull off these military feats which resulted in these resounding defeats that turned the tide of the war in the favor of the Allies. Overall, the Battle of the Bulge was not the major turning point for the European front in that it shifted the tides of the war, but this battle guaranteed that the Nazi forces would not see victory in this war. This battle is also very important to analyze in that it shows the difference in the German forces and strategy from the beginning of the war to the end. At the beginning of the war, the Nazis were aggressive but the attacks were carefully planned out and executed with perfect timing. By the time the Battle of the Bulge happened the majority of the Nazi brain trust was gone and the logistical supremacy that carried their war efforts no longer existed. This lack of strategy and overall firepower led to the German forces failing to meet any objectives in time and in turn led to an abject failure of an attack and eventually the end of the European theatre.
