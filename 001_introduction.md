# Lead up to World War II

"This is not Peace! It is an armistace for 20 years." (Marshall Ferdinand Foch) Germany, follwing it's defeat in World War I, was subject to harsh terms of surrender in the Treaty of Versailles. The war had claimed millions of lives and the victors sought to ensure that another war like it would never occur. However in their pursuit of ultimate peace, they doomed themselves to repeat what they had just endured. The Kasier was replaced with the democratic Weimar Goernment in hopes to foster the growth of a peaceful Germany. However, this new government struggled to maintain order as the nation descended into political chaos. The economic reperations put onto Germnany caused extreme Hyperinflation and economic recession. As the German Mark lost value, extremists began to coalesce and radical parties held more sway over the people. One of these groups was the Nazi Party. This Party would ultimatly take power and lead Germany into another World War. While the war started in favor of Germany; through the three key battles of Dunkirk, Stalingrad, and the Bulge, the Allied Powers were able to swing the tide of war and win.
